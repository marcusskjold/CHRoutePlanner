# CHRoutePlanner
A basic implementation of Contraction Hierarchies for efficient route planning in road networks with performance comparisons to simple Dijkstra algorithms.

*Created by Marcus Skjold {skmp@itu.dk} and Andreas Riget Bagge {anrb@itu.dk} as the third handin for the course Applied Algorithms at the IT University of Denmark.*

## To run

Simply open the gradle directory, and run gradle with `gradle run` (or use the wrapper).
The program recreates all experiments and outputs clearly to standard out.
